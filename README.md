## Motivation

In an entrepreneurship book I was reading, the author details a decision-making framework called a Weighted Decision Matrix.
The book provided a web version, but upon research, it had since disappeared. The UX of other alternatives felt lacking, so I decided to build my own.

## Get Started

This tool is best used in cases where there is a big decision with an array of options and factors to consider. First, list your options and all the relevant factors. Next, give each factor a relative weighting, indicating its importance. Finally, rate each option according to each factor and choose the option with the highest score.
